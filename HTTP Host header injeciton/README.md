## What is the HTTP Host header

The HTTP Host header is a mandatory request header as of HTTP/1.1. It specifies the domain name that the client wants to access. For example, when a user visits https://portswigger.net/web-security, their browser will compose a request containing a Host header as follows:

````
GET /web-security HTTP/1.1
Host: portswigger.net
````
In some cases, such as when the request has been forwarded by an intermediary system, the Host value may be altered before it reaches the intended back-end component.

## What is an HTTP Host header attack

HTTP Host header attacks exploit vulnerable websites that handle the value of the Host header in an unsafe way. If the server implicitly trusts the Host header, and fails to validate or escape it properly, an attacker may be able to use this input to inject harmful payloads that manipulate server-side behavior. Attacks that involve injecting a payload directly into the Host header are often known as "Host header injection" attacks.

## Types of the host header attack

- Web cache poisoning
- Business logic flaws in specific functionality
- Routing-based SSRF
- Classic server-side vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection
