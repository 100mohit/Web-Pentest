## What is the HTTP Host header

The HTTP Host header is a mandatory request header as of HTTP/1.1. It specifies the domain name that the client wants to access. For example, when a user visits https://portswigger.net/web-security, their browser will compose a request containing a Host header as follows:

````
GET /web-security HTTP/1.1
Host: portswigger.net
````
In some cases, such as when the request has been forwarded by an intermediary system, the Host value may be altered before it reaches the intended back-end component.
